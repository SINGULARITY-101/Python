# Python
This repo contains the custom notes and practice codes I made while learning Python. I have tried to make them as detailed as possible so that even a newcomer can understand the notes and learn Python. They are also really helpful when you need to go through some basics every now and then!
CMD is the main notepad file that contains all the notes combined in one single file.
