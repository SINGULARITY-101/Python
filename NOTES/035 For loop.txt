035 FOR LOOPS IN PYTHON 






*SYANTAX FOR LOOP


my_iterable=[1,2,3]

for item_name in my_iterable:
 print(item_name)


*item_name is the variable that represents the objects inside the iterable (in this case a list) 


*you can put for loops on strings, lists, dictionaries, tuple



*For strings you can either declare strings or do like this

 for letter in "abcde":
  print("Its a letter")





*tuple supports tuple enpacking which can be used for a variety of programs (we duplicate the strcuture of the items in the iterable and then unpack them to get access to the individual elements of the tuple)


*Tuple enpacking is useful because many of the functions return information in the form of a list of tuples 









*When you iterate through a dictionary, you only iterate throught the keys. To iterate through the items-
 
  for item in d.items():
        print(item)                             





         OR


   for (key,value) in d.items():
       print(key)       //print(value)




         OR





   for item in d.values():
      print(item)



*Remember dictionaries are unordered
