026 SETS IN PYTHON

*Sets are unordered collection of unique elements

*Meaning there can be no repetitions of the same object inside the set


CREATING A SET

myset=set()
myset.add(1)
myset.add(2)
myset.add(2)        //Will only show {1,2} in the output as repeated values are 		      not allowed




*You can cast a list as a set

mylist=[1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3,3]

set(mylist)        //Will show only {1,2,3}
