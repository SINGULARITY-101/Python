019 STRING FORMATTING AND PRINTING


*STRING INTERPOLATION 
- Basically means sticking a variable in a string
- There are multiple ways to format strings for printing variables in them
- This helps us avoid using string concatenation every time

*Two methods

- .format() method

	-A good way to format objects into your strings for print statements is with the          string.format() method

	EXAMPLE

	print("THIS IS A STRING {}".format("INSERTED"))
	
	-What the format method did was insert the INSERTED text where the curly braces were          present


	-ADVATANGES
		+Allows us to insert strings using string positions
		  
		  EXAMPLE
		  print("THE {} {} {}".format("fox","brown","quick"))

		  By default format() will supply the words in order. However you can change                   the order by using indexes

		  print("THE {2} {1} {0}".format("fox","brown",quick"))


		
		+Allows us to insert strings using keywords

		  EXAMPLE
		  print("THE {q} {b} {f}".format(f="fox",b="brown",q="quick"))


		
		
		+Allows us to do float formatting as well (adjust the width and                               precision of the floating point number)
		
		SYNTAX  
		{variable:width.precision f}
		
		-The width value decides how wide we want the string number to be                             and it adds white spaces accordingly
	
		-Precision sets how many decimal spaces we want after the number

		 EXAMPLE

		 print("THE RESULT IS {r:1.3f}".format(r=result))



	 







- f-strings (formatted string literals)

	-Newer than format method
	-Allows us to skip writing format method and write the varaible name
	 drectly in the curly braces

	EXAMPLE
	name="VISHESH"
	age=3
	print(f"{name} is {age} years old")


	OUTPUT- VISHESH is 3 years old






NOTE: It is also possible use the string concatenation operator + to combine strings             with other variable values, however, those values must first be converted to strings         using the str function.


      All string methods return new values, and DO NOT change the existing string unlike       most list methods which work on the original list
