*SHORTHAND IF CONDITIONAL EXPRESSION

-A common use case of the if statement involves testing a condition and setting the value of  a variable based on the condition 


if condition:
 x=true_value
else:
 x=false_value



-Python provides a shorter syntax, which allows writing such conditions in a single line of  code. It is known as a conditional expression, sometimes also referred to as a ternary  operator. It has the following Syntax:-



x=true_value if <condition> else false_value
