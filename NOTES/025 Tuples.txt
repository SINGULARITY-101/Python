025 TUPLES IN PYTHON

*Tuples are very similar to lists. However they have one key difference- Immutability


*Once an element is inside the tuple it cannot be reassigned


*Tuples use parenthesis (1,2,3)


*Can use len(tuple) to find the length of the tuple


*Can mix and match datatypes just like a list

t=("ONE",2)


*Just like a list you can use slicing and indexing


*Tuple is useful in a program when we want to ensure that elements in a program are not re-assigned or altered  (helps ensure data integrity)











*You can also skip the parentheses while creating a tuple. Python automatically converts comma-seprted values into a tuple 


EXAMPLE

tuple1="a","b","c"
tuple1

OUTPUT:- ('a','b','c')






*Tuples are often used to create multiple variables with a single statement



EXAMPLE

a,b=1,2

a
b


OUTPUT: 1
        2 






USEFUL METHODS 

*Tuples have only two built-in methods:-


 t.count("a")            -Shows how many times a has occured in the tuple
 t.index("a")		 -Returns the index at which a appeared for the first 			                          time
