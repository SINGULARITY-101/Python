041   METHODS AND THE PYTHON DOCUMENTATION


*Built-in objects in python have a variety of methods that you can use

EXAMPLE
-mylist.append(2)
-mylist.pop()

*To get list of methods available for various python objects, there are plenty of ways:
 
 -write "mylist." and hit tab to get a list of methods


*If you want to know what a particular method does you can either write that function and hit shift+tab (jupyter notebook only) or call the help function:

 help(mylist.insert)




*The name "insert" only exists within lists, it does not exist as a standalone name like built in functions such as max or len

*So if we would have called help(insert), python would have complained that no variable named "insert" exists




*Other way you can get a guide on what the methods do is by reading python documentation
