027 BOOLEANS IN PYTHON

*Allows you to convey true or false statements

*Make sure to capitalise T and F in True and False

*You can use the none keyword for an object that we dont want to assign yet but might wanna assign it later in the program

b=none    //Now python won't show error when I call b




*All numbers are treated as true apart from 0

bool(73)         True
bool(0)          False



*All strings are treated as true except the empty string

bool("vk")       True
bool("")         False




*Boolean-to-integer coversion

int(True)        1
int(False)       0



*Remember that True evaluates to 1 and False evaluates to 0 when booleans are used n arithmetic operations
