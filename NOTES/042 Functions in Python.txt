042 FUNCTIONS IN PYTHON

*Functions allows us to create blocks of code that can be easily executed multiple times without needing to constantly rewrite the entire block of code


SYNTAX

def name_of_funtion():
    """

      Docstring explaings function


    """

    print("hello")




OR




def name_of_funtion(name):

     print("Hello " +name)



*Typically we use the return keyword to send back the result of the function instead of just printing it out

*Return allows us to assign the output of a function to a new variable




def add_funtion(num1,num2):

  return num1+num2



*Now if you use help with your custom defined funtion it wont show any description .Now to help with that we will use docstring (Documentation string)


*Functions can be used to solve the pig latin problem( It is a way to transform a normal word into a secret keyword)

RULES
-If a word starts with a vowel, put ay at the end
-If a word does not start with the vowel, put the first letter at the end and then add ay
