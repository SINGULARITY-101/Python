014 VARIABLE ASSIGNMENTS	

*Variable names follow usual rules



*Python uses dynamic typing which means you can reassign variables to the different data types
*This makes python very flexible in assigning data types, this is different than other languages that are statically typed

EXAMPLE :

my_dogs=2;

my_dogs=["Sammy", "Frankie"]

//Okay in Python


*PROS of dynamic typing
 -Not having to write the actual data type
 -Makes the code readable

*CONS of dynamic typing
 -May result in bugs



type()
*Tells us the datatype of a variable

type(a) 



Kernal restart
*Use this if you are getting weird errors. This will clear all the variables and you will have to run all the cells again
