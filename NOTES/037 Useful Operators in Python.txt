037 USEFUL OPERARTORS IN PYTHON


*RANGE function

 -It is a Generator ( It is a special function which generates information without                       saving it all to memeory.)

 -It is a more efficient way of genearating the numbers instead of having a giant   list in the memory


 -range(starting,ending,step)


 -It goes UPTO ending but NOT INCLUDING the ending

 -Step is optional

 -You can do shift+tab to see what parametes it can take


 -for num in range(0,11,2)
      print(num)


 -If you want the numbers generated by the range in the form of a list you will     have to cast it to a list
  
  list(range(0,11,2)) 









*ENUMERATE FUNCTION

-It can take any iterable and return the index count and the object corresponding to it in the form of tuples

-It can be used in conjecture with tuple enpacking to get index and the object correspoding to it seprately



word="abcde"

for item in enumerate(word):
    print(item)





word="abcde"

for (index,letter) in enumerate(word):
    print(index)
    print(letter)
    print("\n")











*ZIP FUNCTION



-Kind of like an opposite of enumerate

-It zips together two lists


 zip(list1,list2)




-If you iterate through the zip function you will get the combined information of the two lists in the form of tuples



for item in zip(list1,list2):
    print(item)




-You can do it with more than one list

-If the lists are uneven, the zip function will zip the files only up to the elements in the smallest list. The rest of the elements will be ignored

-You can use tuple enpacking to extract individual information














*IN OPERATOR

-Can be used to quickly check if an object is in the list

-Returns a boolean value

-Also works on other iterable object types












*MATHEMATICAL FUNCTIONS

-min(mylist)   Returns the minimum value in the list

-max(mylist)   Return the maximum value in the list


*use // to get the quotient without the decimals (that is get an integer)

 
 100/7      14.285714285714286

 100//7     14





*RANDOM LIBRARY

-It is built in and comes with a ton of built in functions

-We will have to import functions from the library

 
   from random import <function>


-Hit tab after import to get a dropdown list of the available functions in the library






-We are going to learn the shuffle function

  
  from random impport shuffle


-What it does is randomly shuffle around any list


  shuffle(mylist) 


-It does not return anything 








-You can also invoke this function like this:-

 import random
 random.shuffle(mylist)









-Another function to grab any random integer is randint

    randint(min,max)

-It will return a random number between min and max













*ACCEPING USER INPUT

-We will use the input function

  result=input("what is your fav number?")

-One thing to remember is that the input function accepts everything as a string

-So if you pass a number, the output will be a string version of the number with quotes

-So you will have to use type casting


 int(result)    or    float(result)   or    result=int(input("fav number"))
