075 PYLINT OVERVIEW


*As you begin to expand to larger multi-file projects it becomes important to have tests in  place

*This way as you make changes or update your code, you can run your test files to make sure  previous code still runs as expected

*There are several testing tools, we will focus on two:-

  -pylint: This is a library that looks at your code and reports back possible issues

  -unittest: This built-in library will allow you to test your own programs and check if you              are getting desired outputs 




*pylint can be used to check your code for possible errors and styling 

*By styling, we mean the set of style convention rules of Python known as "PEP-8"
















*INSTALLING PYLINT

   pip install pylint





*USING PYLINT IN TERMINAL

 - If you are using a newer version of pylint, the report sections is disabled by default so    you have to activate it manually

      pylint simple1.py --reports=yes

 -You will get a lot of information about your code and in the end you will get a rating

 -It is better not to mix white spaces and tabs (mixed indentation). Pylint does not like     mixed indentation
