038 LIST COMPREHENSIONS IN PYTHON

*Unique way of quickly creating a list in python


*Are a good way to avoid using for loop and append statement to create lists




mylist=[]

for item in mystring:
    mylist.append(item)



Can be done simply by typing



mylist=[letter for letter in mystring] 

OR


mylist=[x for x in "word"]


OR


mylist=[num for num in range(0,11)]


OR


mylist=[num**2 for num in range(0,11)]







*You can use this on any iterable object


*You can also add if-else conditions and nested loops as well but the order will be a bit different and it gets quite complicated so fuck that





mylist =[x for x in range(0,11) if x%2==0]     //for even numbers

OR

mylist=[x**2 for x in range(0,11) if x%2==0]   //for square of even numbers






*You can do complex caluclations as well



  celcius=[0,10,20,34.5]

  fahrenheit=[( (9/5)*temp + 32) for temp in celcius]
